# cloud4R
Manage data cloud systems from R

`cloud4R` is a research (experimental) package that will intend to provide a standardized R interface to well-known web cloud data repositories. This will take advantage from R clients already developed, actively maintained and available on CRAN, among them:
* [zen4R](https://github.com/eblondel/zen4R) Client to Zenodo API - supported by IRD, EC OpenAIRE
* [atom4R](https://github.com/eblondel/atom4R) Client to AtomPub / SWORD API
* [ocs4R](https://github.com/eblondel/ocs4R) Client to Open Collaboration Services (OCS) API
* [d4storagehub4R](https://github.com/eblondel/d4storagehub4R) Client to D4Science cloud storage API
